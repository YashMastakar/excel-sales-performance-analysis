## Features & Analysis

### 1. Business Problem
The company needs a centralized, easy-to-digest tool to move beyond static data reports. The core problem is the lack of immediate visibility into **sales performance fluctuations**, the **profitability impact** of individual sales staff, and the **true revenue drivers** among hundreds of product categories. This delay hindered proactive decision-making.

### 2. Goal of the Dashboard
The primary goal is to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. Specifically, the dashboard aims to:
* Track key performance indicators (KPIs): Total Sales, Total Boxes Sold, and Profit Percentage.
* Identify high-impact sales personnel for recognition and training opportunities.
* Visualize monthly and yearly sales trends to forecast seasonal demand and spot anomalies.
* Pinpoint the Top 5 Revenue-Generating Products.

### 3. Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Snapshots)

#### **1: Business Overview** * **KPI Scorecard:** Provides immediate, high-level metrics for Sales, Boxes, and Profit % at the top of the page.
* **Trend Charts:** Displays "Monthly Sales Trend," "Monthly Box Volume Trend," and "Yearly Profit Trend" to help stakeholders visualize performance consistency and growth over time.
* **Personnel Performance:** A detailed table ranks sales team members by their individual sales, expenses, and gross profit, linking individual efforts directly to profitability.

#### **2: Product Sales Analysis** * **Top 5 Revenue Drivers:** A critical bar chart that visually ranks the top-selling products (e.g., 99% Dark & Pure, Choco Coated Almonds) by their absolute sales value, allowing for quick identification of market leaders.
* **Interactive Filters:** Slicers are available on the right for filtering the entire view by `Category` (e.g., Bars, Drinks) and individual `Product` names for deeper analysis.

### 4. Business Impact & Insights

* **Improved Profitability:** By linking sales personnel performance to expenses and profit, management can identify and scale the strategies of the most profitable sales agents, leading to optimized compensation and resource allocation.
* **Enhanced Forecasting:** The detailed monthly and yearly trend charts allow the business to accurately forecast inventory needs and staffing levels, minimizing stockouts and waste.
* **Product Strategy Focus:** The "Top 5 Revenue Drivers" page instantly reveals which products are the financial pillars of the company. This insight allows marketing and production teams to focus their efforts and investments on the high-performing items, maximizing ROI.
